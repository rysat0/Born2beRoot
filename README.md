This project let us to build server by using Debian on the virtual environment.

In 42 cluster, We use Virtual Box to build up.

Install debian fron internet, and set up OS and LVM, systems and so on.

Using GUI is prohibited. Building server up by command line(CUI) is required.

Virtual machine itself is too big(heavy) so we have to upload only hash value.
